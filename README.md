This is a birthday "card" I made for my friend Jasper Nance. Its a video game made in elm, where the player controls me (Chadtech) as I approach Jasper to tell her "Happy Birthday".

Its playable currently at chadtech.us/happy-birthday-jasper.html

Also, this was an exercise in Elm. One of the claims to Elm's advantage, is the speed at which you can code up applications. For the sake of objectivity, it took me 45 minutes to go from an empty directory to this project in completion (not including the time it took to draw the image assets, or the time I spent cleaning up the code).
